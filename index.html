            <p>
              <a href="https://poocooin.github.io/">PooCoin</a>
              has updated its application a number of times since the release to
              improve functionality and add new features. For example, it
              introduced a feature that allows users to see the entry points
              directly inline on the chart to facilitate tracking a trade’s
              progress. PooCoin also has a rug check feature that allows
              checking the integrity of a token. Moreover, PooCoin features a
              swapping option that you can use to swap tokens directly on the
              PooCoin app. An external tools page showcases other useful tools
              for BSC conveniently in one place. A dev wallet checker checks for
              dodgy developer action, such as rugs, slow rugs, and developer
              dumps.
            </p>

            <p>
              Besides the outlined features, PooCoin also offers a couple of
              premium features to coin holders. Holding at least $100 worth of
              POOCOIN/BNB liquidity in the liquidity pool allows users to track
              other traders’ wallets and disable ads. Holding at least $300 in
              the liquidity pool allows you to display your trades and enables
              the wallet transaction tab. Holding at least $2000 unlocks the
              final level, where users can view trending websites and tokens in
              more timescales and list the 100 most popular tokens.

            <h2>PooCoin App Key Features</h2>

            <p>
              One of the selling features of the PooCoin App is the News,
              located in the About tab. It presents articles where readers can
              learn about various coins and chains that the PooCoin app
              supports. However, the viewable articles haven’t been updated
              since their last post in August 2021.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                - Poocoin is a popular cryptocurrency tracking and analytics
                platform primarily focusing on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and

              </li>
              <li>

              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>PooCoin</h2>
            <p>
              The Charts feature shows off price charts for tokens in your
              preferred exchange. You’ll have to connect your wallet first to
              use this part of the site or app. Then, you can maximize the
              search tab or their telegram public chat to view the tokens placed
              in your wallet.
            </p>

            <p>
              The PooCoin chart has a dashboard that provides more details about
              a token in addition to reading candles, analyzing the purchase and
              sell behavior of a contract, and dealing with the actual price of
              a token. These are:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Liquidity </strong>– how simple it is to exchange one
                token for another
              </li>

                <strong>Reading Contracts</strong> – enables users to view a
                token’s DEX transactions and liquidity status
              </li>

                <strong>Transactions</strong> – transparent transaction data
              </li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Roadmap for PooCoin</strong>
            <p>
              However, it's important to note that PooCoin is not a regulated
              financial platform and users should exercise caution when using it
              for trading or investment purposes. It's always a good idea to
              conduct thorough research and consult with a financial advisor
              before making deci-investment.
            </p>

            <strong>What are the Features of Poocoin App?</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Incorporates community-driven features such as token vetting and
                discussion forums to engage users.

            </ul>
            <strong>How to Buy POOCOIN</strong>
            <p>
              As mentioned earlier, you need to hold a specific amount of
              POOCOIN to access their premium features. But since the token is a
              pretty novel coin, people wonder where they could buy it. The
              problem, however, is that due to the newness of POOCOIN, it is yet
              to be listed and supported by popular exchanges.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Before buying Poocoin (POOCOIN), you need a cryptocurrency
                wallet to store your tokens securely. You can choose from
                various options like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or Binance Wallet.
              </li>
              <li>
                Poocoin is typically available for purchase on decentralized
                exchanges (DEXs) like PancakeSwap for Binance Smart Chain (BSC)
                tokens or Uniswap for Ethereum-based tokens.
              </li>
              <li>
                Go to the PancakeSwap or Uniswap website and connect your
                cryptocurrency wallet.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Deposit Funds into Your Wallet:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Ensure you have sufficient funds in your wallet to buy Poocoin.
                You'll need BNB (for BSC) or ETH (for Ethereum) and some extra
                for transaction fees.
              </li>
              <li>
                In PancakeSwap, go to the Trade section and select "Exchange".
                Then click "Select a Currency" and paste the Poocoin contract
                address.
              </li>
              <li>
                In Uniswap, go to the app and click "Select a Token". Paste the
                Poocoin contract address into the search bar.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Set the Amount to Purchase::</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Enter the amount of BNB or ETH you want to swap for Poocoin
                tokens. Make sure to check the current exchange rate and adjust
                accordingly.
              </li>
              <li>
                In PancakeSwap, you may need to adjust the slippage tolerance
                under "Settings" to ensure your transaction goes through
                smoothly. A recommended value is around 10%.
              </li>
              <li>
                Double-check all details, including the token address, the
                amount you're swapping, and any fees involved.
              </li>
              <li>
                Confirm the transaction in your wallet and wait for it to be
                processed on the blockchain.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once the transaction is confirmed, you should see your Poocoin
                tokens in your wallet. You can now hold, trade, or transfer them
                as you wish.
              </li>
              <li>
                You may want to track the performance of your Poocoin investment
                by adding it to your portfolio tracker or watchlist.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What is the fully diluted valuation of PooCoin (POOCOIN)?</h3>

            <p>
              The fully diluted valuation (FDV) of PooCoin (POOCOIN) is
              $1,730,861. This is a statistical representation of the maximum
              market cap, assuming the maximum number of 6.2 Million POOCOIN
              tokens are in circulation today. Depending on how the emission
              schedule of POOCOIN tokens are designed, it might take multiple
